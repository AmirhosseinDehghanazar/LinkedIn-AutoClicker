## üí° Design & Development Insights

This extension was quickly developed as a fun side project, so its design is simple and minimalistic. While it's functional and easy to use, it lacks advanced features and polished aesthetics that you'd expect from a more professional tool.

- **Frontend:** Built with basic HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
- **Popup Design:** A simple, centered UI with neon-inspired borders and dynamic animations to give it a modern touch.
- **Functionality:** Uses DOM manipulation to detect and click buttons, with a configurable delay between clicks.
